# Modal Manager for .NET MAUI  
Dynamic Modal Management and Display in .NET MAUI

---

## 📌 Introduction

Modal Manager is a powerful custom component for .NET MAUI that allows you to manage and display modals (popup windows) in a fully **dynamic**, **flexible**, and **lightweight** way.  
This control can easily accept various controls such as **Button**, **Entry**, or any custom control and display them inside the modal’s content area.

## ⚠️ The main motivation behind developing this project was to overcome the limitations of `PushModalAsync` in MAUI and provide a lightweight, fast, and simple solution for displaying **nested modals**.  
With Modal Manager, modal display speed is significantly improved and modal navigation complexity is greatly reduced.
